Logbook
=======

Have you ever wanted an easy way to timestamp your notes? Well, here you go!

Logbook timestamps your notes and appends them to the end of a TSV (tab-separated value) file.

Use
---

```bash
logbook ~/output.tsv "My message"
```

Install
-------

Add the bash script to your path.

```bash
cp logbook /usr/local/bin/logbook
```

Or, just use it directly:

```bash
./logbook ~/output.tsv "My message"
```
